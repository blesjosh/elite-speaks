3. **Added a Database Status section** to the dashboard that detects and helps fix database issues
4. **Created comprehensive documentation** in `DATABASE_SETUP.md`

## Files Created or Modified

1. `safe_recordings_setup.sql` - Non-destructive SQL script to add missing columns
2. `create_column_function.sql` - Optional SQL function to help with column inspection
3. `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions for database setup
4. `src/components/text-transcription.tsx` - Improved error handling in saveToSupabase function
5. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added database status checking and user guidance
6. `README.md` - Updated with database setup instructions

## How to Fix Database Issues

### Step 1: Run the SQL Setup Script

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Create a new query
5. Paste the entire content from `safe_recordings_setup.sql`
6. Click "Run" to execute the script

The SQL script will:
- Create the `recordings` table if it doesn't exist
- Add any missing columns (`audio_url`, `transcript`, `score`, `ai_feedback`, etc.)
- Set up proper row-level security policies
- Create necessary indexes

### Step 2: Verify Your Database

After running the script, go to the dashboard in your application. The database status check will verify if everything is working properly. If there are still issues, the dashboard will provide guidance.

### Step 3: Test the Recording Flow

1. Record or upload an audio file
2. Transcribe it
3. Get AI feedback
4. Verify it shows up in your Recording History

## New Features Added

- **Database Status Check**: Automatically detects if your database is properly configured
- **Improved Error Messages**: Clear guidance when something goes wrong
- **Non-Destructive Fixes**: Adds missing columns without removing existing data
